1) Implement array equals
    a) make sure to test that arrays with same objects but different number of
    same objects is not equal.  Must test with same number of total objects in
    array

2) Document that did not use matcher DSL.  Easier to test if just used class.

3)  Look to see on diff what should get actual is green or red?
    Answer:  expected is - in red

4) If object is a string and is multi line use differ in failure_message

5) test for json object combinations of (do for actual also)
       first key in map not in expected
       middle key in map not in expected
       last key in map not in expected

6) Do I need to check expected and actual are valid josn?

7) Add comparable function with an selection criteria for and id to compare arrays
